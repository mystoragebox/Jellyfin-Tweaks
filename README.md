# Jellyfin CSS Tweaks
 If you enjoy Jellyfin but want to customise it these styles can get you there. You can change colours, turn images gray-scale and tweak the layout. Let me know if you have any tweaks you would like to see. I'd like to add to this in the future.
## How to Use
 Please see the [Jellyfin CSS Customization](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/clients/css-customization.html) documents for how to use the styles. They have other styles and resources that I use for my install so it's well worth checking out.
## Tweaks
 Below is a list of the tweaks in order on the stylesheet.
 * *Count* colours for the count and played indicator
