# Jellyfin CSS Tweaks
 If you enjoy Jellyfin but want to customise it these styles can get you there. You can change colours, turn images gray-scale and tweak the layout. 
## Helping Out
If you have an idea for a tweak or a whole theme get in touch with me and I'll see what I can do.
## How to Use
 Under Dashboard -> General you will see a custom CSS field, copy the CSS tweaks you would like to use into this field and save. For a better explination please see the [Jellyfin CSS Customization](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/clients/css-customization.html) documents. There's more styles and resources on that page that I use for my install so it's well worth checking out.
